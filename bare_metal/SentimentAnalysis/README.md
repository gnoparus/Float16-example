## Why? 

Traditional NLP models are trained on English and perform poorly on non-English languages and lack of contextual understanding.
With LLMs (Language Model) we can "Prompt and add example" models on non-English languages and use them to perform tasks like sentiment analysis, text generation, slot filling, etc.


## How? 
We using the Float16.cloud API for non-English languages.
